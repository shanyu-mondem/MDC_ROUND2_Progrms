This blog explains the Program1: 
You are provided a string in which characters at odd positions have been 
shifted forward by three letters in the alphabet. Your task is to retrieve the original 
characters and then reverse the string to obtain the final result. 
Note: Special characters and numbers should remain unchanged.

I have used the concept of ASCII values to solve this problem. I use a conditional statement inside the for loop, which checks the following condition:
If the position of the char in the string is odd, then convert it into its ASCII value. If its value lies between the ranges of small alphabets (a-z:97-122) or ranges of capital alphabets(A-Z:65-91), we reduce the ASCII value of the character by 3 and convert it back to character to get the original or intended alphabet.
At the end, we combine the elements of the list to form the original string, and reversing it gives the resultant string

My approach to solving this program is as follows:
Algorithm:
1. Input:
	Take a string as input - s
	We break the string into individual characters, store them into a list - chars

2. Loop:
	Parse through each character in chars
	if position is odd and (ascii values of char is between [97,122] or  ascii values of char is between [65,91]), then replace with letter at 3 positions before it in alphabets

3. Resultant  String:
	The list of characters now contain the characters required to form the original string
	Combine the characters in chars list to form the string and return the reversed string
